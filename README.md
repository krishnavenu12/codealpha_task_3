# Credit Scoring Project

## Overview
This project predicts credit scores based on customer demographics and financial information. It demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and prediction.

## Features
- Load and preprocess raw credit score data
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier)
- Evaluate model performance and make predictions on new data
- Save trained model for future use

I can also make a **shorter, GitHub-friendly version** that looks clean at a glance if you want something even more concise. Do you want me to do that?
